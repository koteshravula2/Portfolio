          Hello! I'm <span className="font-semibold text-blue-600">Kotesh</span>, a passionate Full Stack Developer with a strong foundation in building web applications using React, Node.js, and Python.
          <br /><br />
          I enjoy solving real-world problems through code and continuously learning new technologies. With experience across frontend and backend, I love crafting responsive, clean, and user-friendly interfaces.
          <br /><br />
          When I’m not coding, you’ll find me exploring new tools, watching tech videos, or dreaming up the next cool feature.

  Hello! I'm <span className="font-semibold text-blue-600">Kotesh Ravula</span>, a passionate Full Stack Developer with over 4 years of experience building modern, responsive, and enterprise-grade web applications. My core expertise lies in developing scalable frontends using <strong>React.js, JavaScript, and TypeScript</strong>, and robust backend services using <strong>C# and ASP.NET Core</strong>.

  <br /><br />
  I'm highly motivated by clean architecture, accessibility, and performance optimization. I’ve successfully migrated legacy applications to the cloud, integrated RESTful APIs, built real-time dashboards, and maintained WCAG-compliant UI systems. My current focus includes <strong>cloud technologies (Azure, AWS)</strong>, CI/CD pipelines, and scalable frontends that deliver great UX across all devices.

  <br /><br />
  Whether it's collaborating in Agile teams, leading sprint deliverables, or optimizing SQL queries behind the scenes — I thrive on shipping quality features that solve real-world problems. Outside of work, you’ll find me exploring new frameworks, mentoring peers, or experimenting with ML and AI tools.
